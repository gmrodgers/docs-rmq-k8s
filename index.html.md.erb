RabbitMQ for Kubernetes is a Kubernetes operator that automates provisioning, management and operations of RabbitMQ clusters
running on Kubernetes.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

RabbitMQ for Kubernetes provides a consistent and easy way to deploy RabbitMQ clusters to Kubernetes and
manage their lifecycle. RabbitMQ clusters can be accessed by applications running anywhere - on Kubernetes,
Pivotal Application Service or elsewhere.

RabbitMQ for Kubernetes has two main components:

* Kubernetes operator that automates provisioning, management and operations of RabbitMQ clusters
* Optional OSBAPI-compliant service broker for integration with Pivotal Platform

When combined with Pivotal Application Service, this product provides a single command experience to create RabbitMQ clusters
(cf create-service) and to bind them to a PAS-deployed application (cf bind-service).

## <a id='features'></a>Key Features

Pivotal RabbitMQ for Kubernetes includes the following key features:

* Provisioning of a single-node and 3-node RabbitMQ clusters
* Automatic reconciliation of deployed clusters whenever their actual state does not match the expected state
* Integration with Pivotal Platform through an OSBAPI service broker (optional - this product does not require Pivotal Platform)
* Monitoring of RabbitMQ clusters via Prometheus and Grafana
* Automated upgrades of RabbitMQ clusters (coming soon)

* This product is intended to be used with any Kubernetes distribution. However, given the number of Kubernetes vendors,
  versions and configurations, we cannot guarantee it will work with all of them. The requirements section will be updated as we learn more.
